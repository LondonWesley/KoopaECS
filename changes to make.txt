Koopa: hold on
Aeomi: okay well first
Aeomi: go to eclipse
Aeomi: Block.java
Aeomi: What is block
Koopa: oh
Koopa: this was just gonna be a test for collision
Aeomi: So it's not a world object?
Koopa: just like a little test wall or platform
Koopa: well it would be. but for now i just wanted to get some sort of system down
Aeomi: ok
Aeomi: question
Koopa: yes.
Aeomi: What Components does block have
Koopa: .-.
Aeomi: Thank you
Koopa: my bad
Aeomi: I was so confused
Koopa: sorry about that i just quickly copy and pasted it straight from player
Koopa: becuase lazyness
Koopa: bad habits man ;c
Aeomi: Why is it all static
Aeomi: and why line 17 massive tabs
Aeomi: 16
Koopa: oh i actually dont remember..
Koopa: i think iwas going to organize all the variables in here but then just didint
Aeomi: they're not connected
Aeomi: it's all fine without large tabs
Aeomi: boxCollisionOffsetx -> OffsetX
Koopa: so variables that relate or have a close relation
Aeomi: NO
Aeomi: D:
Aeomi: Change it to boxCollisionOffsetX
Aeomi: I just meant make the x->X
Aeomi: my bad
Koopa: rip
Koopa: becuase iwas like didint you say just name out the variables clearly ._.
Koopa: should i clean this up?
Koopa: i dont think theyre gonna mess with this anyway
Aeomi: nah it's fine
Aeomi: it's debug code
Aeomi: it's always gonna be messy
Koopa: ima just move it and round it down a bit more
Koopa: so its easier to read on screen
Aeomi: yeah sure
Koopa: I may have to work on this later
Koopa: i gotta get this stencil done
Koopa: before our christmas break
Aeomi: ah gotca
Koopa: but ill just save the chat log so i know what to change later
Aeomi: goodluck c: and ok
Koopa: also how do you feel on that idea though
Koopa: ill see if i can come up with a better way of doing the collision
